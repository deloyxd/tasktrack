This is my first complete project, for official public release. I made this project to help me focus on my other projects, and to keep track of what I should do. Also, it was because of curiosity about vibe coding. I may get hooked.

This is a product of a vibe coding setup:
- VSC
- Roo Code
- gemini-2.5-pro-exp

App Description:
A simple and minimalist task tracker app that tracks and manages your tasks progress.
